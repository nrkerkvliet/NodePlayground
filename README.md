# NodePlayground

The following directories contain code for NodeJS and MongoDB web application.

The code is not meant to the magnum opus of my abilities but instead a representation of concepts I am learning.

Some modules being used are:  Express, Mongoose, Joi

The general flow of the files is learning concepts in a specific directory then applying those concepts to a larger web application
in the "Vidly" directory.
